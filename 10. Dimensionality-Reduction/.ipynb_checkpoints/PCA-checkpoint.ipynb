    "## The curse of Dimensionality\n",
    "\n",
    "Humans are bound by their perception of a maximum of three dimensions. We can’t comprehend shapes/graphs beyond three dimensions. Often, data scientists get datasets which have thousands of features. They give birth to two kinds of problems:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Increase in computation time:** Majority of the machine learning algorithms they rely on the calculation of distance for model building and as the number of dimensions increases it becomes more and more computation-intensive to create a model out of it. For example, if we have to calculate the distance between two points in just one dimension, like two points on the number line, we’ll just subtract the coordinate of one point from another and then take the magnitude:\n",
    "\n",
    "Distance= $ x_1-x_2 $\n",
    "\n",
    "What if we need to calculate the distance between two points in two dimensions?\n",
    "\n",
    "The same formula translates to:\n",
    "Distance= $ \\sqrt {(x_1-x_2)^2+(y_1-y_2)^2} $\n",
    "\n",
    "What if we need to calculate the distance between two points in three dimensions?\n",
    "\n",
    "The same formula translates to:\n",
    "Distance= $ \\sqrt {(x_1-x_2)^2+(y_1-y_2)^2+(z_1-z_2)^2}$\n",
    "\n",
    "And for N-dimensions, the formula becomes:\n",
    "Distance=$ \\sqrt {(a_1-a_2)^2+(b_1-b_2)^2+(c_1-c_2)^2+…+(n_1-n_2)^2} $\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the effort of calculating the distance between two points. Just imagine the number of calculations involved for all the data points involved.\n",
    "\n",
    "One more point to consider is that as the number of dimension increases, points are going far away from each other. This means that any new point that comes when we are testing the model is going to be farther away from our training points. This leads to a less reliable model, and it makes our model overfitted to the training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Hard (or almost impossible) to visualise the relationship between features:** As stated above, humans can not comprehend things beyond three dimensions. So, if we have an n-dimensional dataset, the only solution left to us is to create either a 2-D or 3-D graph out of it. Let’s say for simplicity, we are creating 2-D graphs. Suppose we have 1000 features in the dataset. That results in a  total (1000*999)/2= 499500 combinations possible for creating the 2-D graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "Is it humanly possible to analyse all those graphs to understand the relationship between the variables?\n",
    "\n",
    "**The questions that we need to ask at this point are:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Are all the features really contributing to decision making?\n",
    "* Is there a way to come to the same conclusion using a lesser number of features?\n",
    "* Is there a way to combine features to create a new feature and drop the old ones?\n",
    "* Is there a way to remodel features in a way to make them visually comprehensible?\n",

    "## Principal Component Analysis: \n",
    "The principal component analysis is an unsupervised machine learning algorithm used for feature selection using dimensionality reduction techniques. As the name suggests, it finds out the principal components from the data. PCA transforms and fits the data from a higher-dimensional space to a new, lower-dimensional subspace This results into an entirely new coordinate system of the points where the first axis corresponds to the first principal component that explains the most variance in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What are the principal components?**\n",
    "Principal components are the derived features which explain the maximum variance in the data. The first principal component explains the most variance, the 2nd a bit less and so on. Each of the new dimensions found using PCA is a linear combination of the old features.\n",
    "\n",

    "#### Explained Variance Ratio\n",
    "\n",
    "All of the above questions are answered using the *explained variance ratio*. It represents the amount of variance each principal component is able to explain.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, suppose if the square of distances of all the points from the origin that lie on PC1 is 50 and for the points on PC2 it’s 5.\n",
    "\n",
    "EVR of PC1=$\\frac{Distance of PC1 points}{( Distance of PC1 points+ Distance of PC2 points)}=\\frac{50}{55}=0.91 $\n",

    "Thus PC1 explains 91% of the variance of data. Whereas, PC2 only explains 9% of the variance. Hence we can use only PC1 as the input for our model as it explains the majority of the variance.\n",
